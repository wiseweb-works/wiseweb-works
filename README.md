I am a web designer and blog writer who supports Wise Web's. I love programming, writing, speaking and traveling.

As a web designer and system security volunteer, I work to make the world a better place. I'm starting this by making the internet a safer place to browse without selling our personal data. I believe that everyone should be able to surf the Internet in a private and secure way, without being tracked, as in 1999. The breakthrough of the previous century was the Wide Web World. The breakthrough of this century will be Wise Web Works.

📊 **Some of my favorite words:**
- If I can do the same with less or least, I should do it that way
- It is more difficult to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.
- Every system is 100% (!) secure if you are fool
- If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it.
- They invented it to use punctuation marks. Not for ignoring.
